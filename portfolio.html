	    <h2>We made a game similar to the popular toy, Etch-A-Sketch.
In our game, the player uses the arrow keys to maneuver an arrow around and inside a designated boarder. If the player chooses
to do so they can change the color of their arrow and change the color of the arrow's trail.</h2>

	      <h2>This was our 1.2.5 project! We made a fully interactive game in which the user has to press a series of arrows using the arrow keys. 
		As the user progresses, the levels get harder and the backgrounds change. We randomized the arrow directions and if the player made a mistake, the sequence restarts. </h2>

	<h2> In this project we were told to use data from 4 different sensors to locate the biome of a lost Rover. 
	    We separated the data into 4 different categories and figured out what data fit with what sensor based on the descriptions 
	    of each location. Below is our graph of the separated data. We believe the blue data is our temperature readings,
	    the green data is our light sensor, the red data is our sound readings, and the yellow sensor is the wind readings.</h2>

	   <h2>In this project we found that our graph plotted the data of the amount of honey each state produced. 
		   Large producers produced 7,500,000 million lbs. of honey while medium produces produced 2,500,000 lbs. of honey. 
		   Any lower production levels would be small producers.</h2>
